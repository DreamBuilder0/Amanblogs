  					<title>The Internet: A New Drug?</title>
						<p>Nowadays turning to the web for even a spec of information is starting to become habitual more than anything. In the recent past, the internet was something stationary, only available on our home desktops but now it exists in everything that we use in our daily lives. As the web starts to gain more access into our lives, there are severe consequences that follow even though the short-term effects may not be immediately apparent. Scientists are starting to worry that everyone using the internet in today’s world is mostly using it to complete tasks that their brain is more than capable of doing. Ultimately, the way that we utilize the internet affects our desire to think, be social and retain certain types of information.
						</p>
						<p>
						Although most people may not be concerned about the growing use of the web, the long term effects are starting to come forward. With the internet available at everyone’s fingerprints, the modern generations are starting to lack core competencies such as critical thinking as compared to the previous generations. Firstly, the king of online search, Google, tremendously changes the way our brain processes particular types of information and our ability to think or reason. In a recent study, researchers found that participants who use Google have an increased brain activity dealing with decision making, vision and complex reasoning (Fitts). “It’s a model that’s very similar to what happens when you start exercising your muscles,” he says. “It’s exhausting at first, and then once you start increasing the weight, you can lift more weight with less energy” (Fitts). Fitts portrays that using the internet is like lifting weights, once you start to depend on it for your daily sources of information, it becomes incredibly easier the next time to give in rather than problem solve and think on your own. Depending on search engines for answers to all of one’s questions results in the brain becoming lazy and incapable of performing even the simplest tasks. Studies have also depicted that anyone with access to search engines is more likely to overestimate their intelligence and people who read online are more prone to skimming (Fitts). Researchers at Columbia, Harvard and the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that “people are less likely to remember a place of trivia when they had access to the internet and more liable to remember where the information is stored” (Fitts). Those using the internet for searching up vast amounts of information are beginning to transform the use of their brain’s primary functions.
						</p>
						<p>
						The internet’s benign nature is not only affecting our brain’s reasoning abilities but also our psychological well-being. In a survey, scientists have found that sixty percent of college students prefer emails compared to a “face-to-face” interaction with other classmates when it comes to getting work done, and only four percent of them believed it had an adverse impact on their relationships with others (Bargh). When it comes to personal matters, studies found that heightened internet use resulted in increases of depression, loneliness, and neglection of existing close relations (Bargh). Not to mention the growing use of social media sites is also contributing to the lack of proper social skills in the newer generations. New York Behavioral Health buttresses this notion when they state,
						When we engage in face-to-face communication, social information is conveyed by vocal and visual cues in the context of the situation. Non-verbal communication is an important part of communicating, and it includes facial expressions, eye contact, tone of voice as well as posture, space between individuals (N.Y.B.H)
						According to the article, it is important for one to understand the non-verbal parts of the communication because we need to modify our behaviors according to the reaction of others (N.Y.B.H). Studies have also found that children and adolescents who prefer communicating online as opposed to face-to-face, are lacking critical skills such as, making eye contact and learning from body language cues (N.Y.B.H). In a controlled experiment scientists examined a group of children that were “forced” to spend time with their peers without having any availability to the internet or any form of electronic communication and concluded that children who engaged with each other and the adults around them made a significant difference in their social skills. The children’s ability to notice and learn from particular types of facial expressions significantly improved (N.Y.B.H). The increased use of the internet hinders the social interactions that take place between our younger generations, and face-to-face communications are vital to their proper psychological development.
					 </p>

						The internet wasn’t always as powerful as it is today. With the combination of certain features from its predecessors like telephone, telegraph, etc. the internet has made a remarkable difference in the way we communicate and interact with others around us. One of the significant consequences of the growing use of the web results in the deterioration of the ability to think and problem solve efficiently; the one quality that makes us human. Researchers have found that individuals who depend on the search engines for the answers to all their problems tend to have a lethargic mind that’s inadequate of completing small tasks. Search engines like Google also hinder our ability to retain certain types of information that we read online. A person is more likely to recall where the information exists rather than the contents of it which are crucial to one’s understanding. The lack of social skills is another “side-effect” of the increased use of the online web. Studies exhibit that people with addictions to the online world, generally feel lonely and depressed because of the lack of “face-to-face” communication. This notion is also present in children who are responsible for tomorrow’s youth, and it is crucial that they receive the proper social interactions to be successful on all three sides of their health triangle.
